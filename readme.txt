This game is inspired by Pet Pals 2, a game I played as a child.
It is a simple game where you can take care of a pet, play minigames, and explore the world.

The twist being that your pet can die if you don't take care of it properly.

For the scope of this class project (2 days), I implemented the following features:
- A pet that can be fed, dance, and be cleaned
- A world with a few interactable objects
- A pet creation screen

# How to clone and run
1 Clone the entire repository and open with IntelliJ (or compatible IDE)
2 Run the game from TitleScreen
3 Have fun

# How to play
- Reference the controls at the top of the screen
-- `WASD` to move
-- `F` to dance
-- `Space` to sleep
-- `Esc` to pause
- Reference the status bars (pet's needs) at the bottom of the screen
- Clean your pet by swiping over it while holding the left mouse button
- Colliding with objects will interact with them
-- Feed your pet by colliding with the food bowl
-- Water your pet by colliding with the water bowl
