# Untitled Pet Game by Zander "Xitral" Polk
This game is inspired by Pet Pals 2, a game I played as a child.
It is a simple game where you can take care of a pet, play minigames, and explore the world.

The twist being that your pet can die if you don't take care of it properly.

> [!NOTE]
> This game was made in two days as a project for ITSC 1213 (Computer Science II), bugs may likely be present.

For the scope of this project, I implemented the following features:
- A pet that can be fed, dance, and be cleaned
- A world with a few interactable objects
- A pet creation screen

## How to clone and run
1. Clone the entire repository and open with IntelliJ (or compatible IDE)
2. Run the game from TitleScreen
3. Have fun

## How to Play
> [!TIP]
> Reference the controls at the top of the screen
>  - `WASD` to move
>  - `F` to dance
>  - `Space` to sleep
>  - `Esc` to pause

> [!TIP]
> Clean your pet by swiping over it while holding the left mouse button

> [!TIP]
> Colliding with objects will interact with them
>  - Feed your pet by colliding with the food bowl
>  - Water your pet by colliding with the water bowl

> [!TIP]
> Watch the status bars (pet's needs) at the bottom of the screen

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Survive
